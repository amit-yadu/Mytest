##  operators
- In order to manipulate and work with variables and values in C, we are have a number of operators at our disposal.
- Lets take a look at some of these now.

### Arithmetic operators: 
- in C we can add(+),subtract(-),multiply(*),divide(/) numbers,as expected.
  
  eg):
   int x = y+1; // if y=10
   x = x*5;     // x=55

- We also have the modulus operator,(%) which gives us the remainder when the number on the left of the operator is divided by the number on the right.
 
eg): 
 int m = 13 % 4; // m is now 1
 
### Boolean Expression :
- Boolean expression are used in  C for comparing values.
- We can use the result of evaluting a boolean expressionn in other programming constructs such as deciding which branch in conditional to take, or detrmine whether a loop should continue to run.
- Logical operators:
   1) Logical And(&&)
       if (x=true && y=true)--> true
       else--> false;
   2) Logical OR(||) 
       if(atleast 1 operend is true)--> true
	   else--> false;
	   
  3) Logical NOT(!)
      if(true)--> false
	  false--> true
	  
### Relational Operators :
- Used with Airthematic
- lessthan(x>y)
- lessthan or equal to(x<=y)
- greaterthan(x>y)
- greater than or equal to(x>=y)
### Relational Operators :
 - Eqality(x==y)
 - Ineqality(x!=y)
